This means you need not have both Intranet and Internet devices at all times; you can log in to your Internet device before you leave your office, and for 24 hours be able to create forms from one Internet device."

If user chooses “Complaint” response should route to Complaints Department, but if user chooses “IT” response should route to IT Department. There’s no such feature on FormSG, but you can set mail forwarding rules on your email. For example, one such rule can detect “Complaint” in the form response email, and forward this to the Complaints Department automatically. To set such mail forwarding rules, you have to Create Rule, then select Advanced Options. Next, select the condition as “with specific words in the body”: Click on the underlined “specific words”, and specify “IT department”. Next, select the action as “forward it to people or public group”: Click on the underlined “people or public group” and specify the IT department’s email."

We took out Save Draft because there is no good place to save such data - our servers do not store data, and saving data on the local computer might leak this out to unintended recipients if form is filled from a library computer. Furthermore, it’s more important to advise the user how long it takes to fill in the form, so they have sufficient time to submit in one sitting, which is a better user experience than saving draft and coming back repeatedly. In the future after launch of Storage mode, we might consider re-enabling Save Draft function."

We auto-compress images to 1024x768 resolution, which is typically less than 1 MB. This is a hard limit because the email service we use has a fixed 10 MB outgoing size, and we buffer 3 MB for email fields and metadata. Because the smallest unit you can attach per attachment field is 1 MB, you can have a max of 7 attachments on your form. If your user has to submit more than 7 documents, you may create just one attachment field of 7 MB, and advise your user to zip documents up and submit as one attachment. In the future after launch of Storage mode, we are considering raising this size limit to 20 MB."

An example response to a table style question asking for name, age, hobbies is: “Mr Tan,55,Soccer, Tennis, Taichi”. Excel will split this correctly into “Mr Tan”, “55”, and “Soccer, Tennis, Taichi” because it ignores the commas in hobbies that have spaces after them."

There are two junctures where they might be blocked, but the form submitter will know about it and will be able to retry: When a user clicks Submit on his form, the response first goes to our server. Before reaching our server, we have a web application firewall that detects for malicious content and might block the submission. If blocked, a user will see a “Please try again later” message on the form. If the form passes the web application firewall, it goes to our server, and we email it to your government email (SGMail) without storing it on our servers. If the government email does not exist then your response will bounce and the user will see a “Please try again later” message on the form. From here on out, if the email is blocked, your user will not be aware. But there is still a way for you as the form creator to retrieve the blocked responses: If the government email exists, it proceeds to SGMail servers. Before it enters SGMail, it will arrive at SGMail’s firewall. This firewall will block out emails if there are attachments with non-whitelisted file extensions, for e.g. “.abc” or “.mov”. We are not aware of the full list of file extensions that SGMail whitelists, but most of the file extensions that are whitelisted can be viewed here on our spreadsheet. If your email gets blocked due to non-whitelisted attachment file extensions, you will receive a mail hygiene notification. You may contact SPEAR (spear@tech.gov.sg) within 1 month from receiving the mail hygiene notification to retrieve the dropped mail."

"text": "How do you enable SingPass or CorpPass? All you have to do is enter an e-service ID on the Settings tab of your form to enable SPCP: An e-service ID is a unique billing ID given by the SingPass/CorpPass office to your department’s finance team. An invalid e-service ID will yield a 138 error for SingPass and 328 error for CorpPass. If you don’t already have an e-service ID, you can either ask your agency IT department to find an e-service ID to reuse, or contact SPCP rep alvin_wee@tech.gov.sg to create a new one. When testing your e-service ID you may log in to our UAT server, https://uat.form.gov.sg and create test forms there. Note that accounts and forms are separate on UAT and Live servers and cannot be transferred over. To track number of submissions at your e-service ID you may visit the Billing Panel tab on the top right of your forms dashboard: It is up to you to decide if you want 2FA or 1FA e-service ID. For CorpPass, it is also up to you to decide whether you want authorisation work flows at your e-service ID. Consult SPCP rep on this if you have concerns."
