# FormSG - User Guide

FormSG is self-service and typically does not need a guide. The best way to learn about the service is to [log in](https://form.gov.sg/#!/signin) and create your first form. 

We also have a constantly updated deck of slides for you to share with your peers: [https://go.gov.sg/formsg-sharing-slides](https://go.gov.sg/formsg-sharing-slides)

There are three sections in this guide:
- First, keep up to date with FormSG developments by viewing our Updates section.
- Second, if you are a new user, access "READ THIS FIRST" on the menu.
- Third, if you are looking for tips and tricks or workarounds to common issues, check out our Advanced Guide. If you have tips of your own to share, we're all ears. You may visit our Github repository and update our guide directly. Instructions of how to are in the Advanced Guide.
